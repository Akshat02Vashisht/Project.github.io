                <h1>WHY WE DO IT</h1>
                <p>Everyone remembers the first book they ever read. From Dr. Seuss to Curious George – there is something so special about picking up a book and reading it from beginning to end. The ability to get lost in a story, get to know and love characters, and
                     learn about places you’ve never been before – books and education have a lasting impression on us all.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="text-1">
                
                <p>Most people in developed countries are lucky to have access to schools, the ability to have resources to further their education. For many in developing countries education is a luxury, something so valued but sadly not accessible to everyone. With poverty on the rise, unsettling crisis and bad living conditions, underdeveloped countries are not able to put education as a priority. Children who have the desire to learn, read, socialize with kids their own age are robbed of these opportunities due to a lack of schools in their community. There are those who dream of being a doctor, nurse or even a teacher, but without the economic resources to build new schools or rebuild the ones that were destroyed by natural disasters, the possibility of pursuing their dream becomes lost along with their hope of creating a better future for themselves.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="text-1">
                
                <p>Who wouldn’t want to give back to these children? Who wouldn’t want to be a small part of these children’s bright future and success? Education is lacking, but their spirit and desire to learn is alive and well. This is why we are driven to support these children and give them an opportunity to achieve their dreams.</p>

        <p>Education lights every stage of the journey to a better life, especially for the poor and the most vulnerable.</p>

        <p>Education’s unique power to act as a catalyst for wider development goals can only be fully realized, however, if it is equitable. That means making special efforts to ensure that all children and young people – regardless of their family income, where they live, their gender, their ethnicity, whether they are disabled – can benefit equally from its transformative power. Education empowers girls and young women, in particular, by increasing their chances of getting jobs, staying healthy and participating fully in society – and it boosts their children’s chances of leading healthy lives. To unlock the wider benefits of education, all children need the chance to complete not only primary school but also lower secondary school. And access to schooling is not enough on its own: education needs to be of good quality so that children actually learn. Given education’s 
            transformative power, it needs to be a central part of any global development framework.</p>
